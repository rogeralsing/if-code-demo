Add more error handling. e.g. clear and easy to understand error messaging using standard http response patterns. 
e.g.
this part:
        var context = new ValidationContext(request);
        // Minimal APIs do not trigger DataAnnotations automatically
        if (!Validator.TryValidateObject(request, context, new List<ValidationResult>(), true))
            return Results.BadRequest();

We should inform the user of what validation failed.

Use Polly for retries on the http client class from insurance to vehicle service.

This needs extra attention, requirements missing:
"Handling of edge cases (e.g., missing vehicles, no insurances, multiple insurances)."

You can have multiple cars, you can have multiple pets, you probably canÂ´t have multiple personal health insurances.
