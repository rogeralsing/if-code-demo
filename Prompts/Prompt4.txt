Let´s do the Insurance service. check how the Vehicle service is structured and set up.
Do the same for this. 
See the "NET - Assignment Instructions" for further instructions

sub prompt 1:

According to the specs. prices should be per insurance type:

Insurance products and prices:

• Pet insurance: $10
• Personal health insurance: $20
• Car insurance: $30

Also, use an Enum for the Insurance type.

Also make a comment on the enum why we are not doing polymorphism, e.g. the current requirement is bounded, not unbounded. and good enough for now

sub prompt 2:

"record InsuranceResponse(string Type,"

I want the enum in the response.
But make it serialize as string in the json
