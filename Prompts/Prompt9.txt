VehicleApiClient does not gracefully handle other exceptions than 404.
explicitly signal 503 Service Unavailable in insurance service if vehicle service returns any form of http exception except 404. 

Also, replace the bloated validation code in both endpoints with https://www.nuget.org/packages/MinApiLib.Validation

Remove dead usings.

delete .http files

use an /api/v1/ scheme for urls. 

move endpoints and their contract types into separate files.
attach the endpoint using an extension method from program.cs

move data and clients into separate files. implementations and interfaces can go in the same files.

sub prompt 1:

Stop changing .net version, we should be on .net 9... add that as a hard requirement in agents.md and fix the dependencies.
